# Channel Estimation Using Mixed Resolution Data

In various communication systems such as wireless sensor networks, MIMO communications,
and cognitive radio, mixed-resolution architectures that incorporate both 1-bit and high-
resolution data have proven beneficial. These architectures strike a balance between adhering
to physical constraints and achieving significant performance improvements. However, working
with mixed-resolution models introduces new challenges in designing estimation and learning
methods for the data they produce. The objective of this study, which is the main part of my thsis, is to explore various aspects of a
mixed-resolution data system for diverse applications of signal processing algorithms. I am
examining challenges at the context of channel estimation, focusing on metrics like
MSE estimators and boundaries. The goal is to determine how mixed-resolution observations
can be harnessed to create a cost-effective yet highly efficient system.
